*Project Title: Analyze the sentiment of TikTok Posts and Usersâ€™ Comments with Hashtags Related to Covid-19*

This TikTok Scraper was developed as part of my project for the Seminar on Management Topics (I) course at NYCU, designed to collect and analyze 2.35 million posts and user comments related to COVID-19 using the Apify API.

## Overview
This project explores the sentiment of TikTok users during the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed data from posts and comments under hashtags related to the outbreak using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and VADER sentiment analysis. By examining public emotions from 2019 to 2023, our study highlights trends in user sentiment and provides insights into how people expressed themselves during this global event.

## Key Findings
* **Positive Sentiment Dominates**: Despite the challenges of the pandemic, 1 in 4 comments were positive, with a surprisingly low frequency of negative sentiment.
* **Peak Engagement**: The year 2020 saw the highest level of discussions, aligning with the peak of global concern about COVID-19.
* **No Correlation Between Post and Comment Sentiment**: Analysis showed that the sentiment of posts did not influence the sentiment of comments.

## Framework
Our approach includes:
1. **Data Collection**: Crawled TikTok posts and comments using the Apify TikTok Scraper.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and organized the dataset using Python libraries like Pandas.
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Used the VADER tool to classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral.
4. **Visualization**: Created word clouds, scatterplots, and pie charts to display trends and findings.

## Tools and Technologies
* **Data Scraping**: Apify
* **Programming Language**: Python
* **NLP & Sentiment Analysis**: VADER
* **Visualization**: Matplotlib

## Results
* **Sentiment Distribution**: Comments exhibited primarily neutral sentiment, with fewer extreme values.
* **Word Cloud Analysis**: Highlighted common terms and emotions expressed by users.
* **Engagement Trends**: The frequency of posts and comments peaked in 2020, reflecting heightened public concern.

## Future Work
Building on this research, we aim to:
* Expand the analysis to other social media platforms.
* Explore multimodal analysis incorporating videos, images, and text.
* Investigate brand influence and communication strategies during public crises.
